Hey all,

Thank you for downloading my game. Hope you'll like it. Just a few install tips below:

1) Whenever you first download the game you should download the following files:
	A) The latest HTML file - Currently V0.8.7.0 - the name is: 'Life choices V0.8.7.0.html'
	B) The latest main image pack, also called data folder - Currently V0.8.7.0 - the name is: 'Amsterdam.zip'
	(A+B) Note: It could be that A & B are combined in one download. If it is, there is only one download button.)
	C) The additional image pack - Currently there is none

2) Make sure that your main folder (can have any name) only has 2 things in it: 
	A) The folder Amsterdam
	B) The HTML file 'Life Choices'

3) Any current version of the game and the data folder can be thrown away completely!

4) It should look like the example picture (Example.jpg), which I included in the Data folder where you found these instructions. (FYI: The folder Amsterdam has a lot of subfolders with all the vids/pictures).

5) For any feedback, questions or remarks, or to download the game, please go to either one of the following:
	A) My Patreon site: https://www.patreon.com/BurningSun
	B) Where I first uploaded the game: http://www.tfgamessite.com/?module=viewgame&id=953
	C) The F95 zone: https://f95zone.com/threads/life-choices-v0-8-5-3-burningsun.7/

That's it & have fun playing the game.
